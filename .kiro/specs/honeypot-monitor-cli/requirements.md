# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves developing a CLI-based monitoring application for Kippo honeypot traffic analysis. The application will provide an interactive terminal user interface (TUI) similar to lazydocker, allowing security analysts to monitor, investigate, and analyze honeypot activity in real-time. The tool will run locally on the same host as the honeypot, providing easy installation and deployment through an interactive setup script.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want a CLI application with an interactive TUI interface, so that I can monitor honeypot activity without needing a GUI environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a terminal-based interface with navigation panels
2. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL respond to keyboard shortcuts similar to lazydocker
3. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL use colors and formatting to highlight important information
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL show real-time status indicators for honeypot monitoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to monitor Kippo honeypot logs in real-time, so that I can detect interesting activity as it happens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects to Kippo logs THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor log file changes
2. WHEN new log entries appear THEN the system SHALL parse and display them in the interface
3. WHEN interesting activity is detected THEN the system SHALL highlight or flag the activity
4. WHEN log parsing fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and continue monitoring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to investigate historical log data, so that I can analyze patterns and past incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing historical data THEN the system SHALL provide search and filter capabilities
2. WHEN browsing logs THEN the system SHALL support pagination and date range selection
3. WHEN filtering data THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by IP address, commands, and activity type
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support exporting filtered results to common formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to identify and categorize interesting activity, so that I can focus on potential threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing traffic THEN the system SHALL automatically categorize activity types (login attempts, command execution, file transfers)
2. WHEN detecting suspicious patterns THEN the system SHALL flag them with severity levels
3. WHEN reviewing flagged activity THEN the system SHALL provide detailed context and related events
4. WHEN customizing detection THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of custom rules and thresholds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want easy installation and deployment, so that I can quickly set up the monitoring tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the install script THEN the system SHALL provide an interactive setup with recommended defaults
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL automatically handle Python package management
3. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL detect honeypot installation paths automatically
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify the installation and provide usage instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the application to run reliably on the honeypot host, so that monitoring doesn't interfere with honeypot operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL consume minimal system resources
2. WHEN accessing log files THEN the system SHALL use read-only access to prevent interference
3. WHEN the honeypot restarts THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resume monitoring
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log issues without crashing the monitoring process

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to view network connection details and session information, so that I can understand attacker behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying connections THEN the system SHALL show source IPs, connection times, and session duration
2. WHEN analyzing sessions THEN the system SHALL display command history and file access patterns
3. WHEN tracking attackers THEN the system SHALL correlate activities across multiple sessions
4. WHEN viewing details THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities for specific incidents
